                        This type of coffee is grown under the shade of taller trees, 
                        which provides natural protection from direct sunlight. Shade 
                        cultivation contributes to a slower and more gradual development of the beans.

            <h2>Cultivation</h2>
            <p>
                Coffee cultivation in Antigua is mainly carried out using traditional and sustainable methods. 
                Farmers in the region use careful cultivation techniques, such as hand-picking of ripe beans 
                and the implementation of shade practices, which protect the coffee trees from direct sunlight 
                and promote biodiversity in the coffee plantations.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                The process begins with the sowing of seeds in nurseries or directly in the fields. 
                The seeds are carefully selected and planted in soils rich in nutrients, 
                characteristic of the volcanic region of Antigua. The coffee plantations 
                are cultivated at altitudes that vary between 1,200 and 1,800 meters above 
                sea level, taking advantage of the ideal climatic conditions of the area.
